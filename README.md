# <Social Network App>

## Description

In this UofT bootcamp challenge, we were tasked with creating a basic nosql database that can act as the backend for a social network app. It challenged our ability to create a database in MongoDB, and properly define the routes to search the different documents in the database. It was interesting to in a way translate what I learned about mysql, to a non sql database and to see the parallels between the two.

## Usage

First npm i, then run the node index.js in the social network app directory from the command line. This will start the server. Now you can explore the CRUD routes with an application like insomnia or postman.
